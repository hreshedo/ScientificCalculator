Scientific Calculator Project

Authors: Candace Cooley, Hasset Reshedo, Mariam Siddiqui

In this bonus project we are navigating GitHub while creating a Scientific calculator.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Python script uses tkinter to create a graphical interface for a simple scientific calculator. The ScientificCalculator class defines the logic and UI of the calculator. The create_ui method initializes the application window, display, and buttons. Buttons include numbers, operators, and functions like "C" (clear), "AC" (all clear), and "=" (calculate). Methods handle input validation, arithmetic operations, and error handling, such as division by zero. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, division, and displays results up to 8 digits or shows "ERR" if exceeded.

Hasset Reshedo:
- Created the GUI for the calculator
- Added Basic Operations (+,-,*, & /)
- Added 'C' (Clear)
- Added 'AC' (All Clear)
- Added the 'ERR' - Exceeding the 8 -digit limit
All in Java Code



=======

In this project we used GitHub to work togther to create a Calculator. 

Feature the calculator includes are:
User can see a display showing the current number entered or the result of the last operation.
 User can see an entry pad containing buttons for the digits 0-9, operations - '+', '-', '/', and '=', a 'C' button (for clear), and an 'AC' button (for clear all).
 User can enter numbers as sequences up to 8 digits long by clicking on digits in the entry pad. Entry of any digits more than 8 will be ignored.
 User can click on an operation button to display the result of that operation on:
the result of the preceding operation and the last number entered OR
the last two numbers entered OR
the last number entered
 User can click the 'C' button to clear the last number or the last operation. If the users last entry was an operation the display will be updated to the value that preceded it.
 User can click the 'AC' button to clear all internal work areas and to set the display to 0.
 User can see 'ERR' displayed if any operation would exceed the 8 digit maximum.

 User can click a '+/-' button to change the sign of the number that is currently displayed.
 User can see a decimal point ('.') button on the entry pad to that allows floating point numbers up to 3 places to be entered and operations to be carried out to the maximum number of decimal places entered for any one number."


 ***Bugs in python code: I couldn't get the a max on the number of decimal places you could input but once you did the calculation the outout only displayed the 3 decmal places.
