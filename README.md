Scientific Calculator Project

Authors: Candace Cooley, Hasset Reshedo, Mariam Siddiqui

In this bonus project we are navigating GitHub while creating a Scientific calculator.

The Python script uses tkinter to create a graphical interface for a simple scientific calculator. The ScientificCalculator class defines the logic and UI of the calculator. The create_ui method initializes the application window, display, and buttons. Buttons include numbers, operators, and functions like "C" (clear), "AC" (all clear), and "=" (calculate). Methods handle input validation, arithmetic operations, and error handling, such as division by zero. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, division, and displays results up to 8 digits or shows "ERR" if exceeded.
